### A list of ideas for projects or just making insteresting stuff
- [ ] terminal streamer using asciinema, with damage events for minimum payload in updates. research compression of text data (watch and understand theprimeagen's particle system)
- [ ] webtransport message framing [WIP](https://github.com/JimitSoni18/transport-io)
- [x] ansi terminal text xml representation [WIP](https://github.com/JimitSoni18/anscii)
- [ ] a media streaming platform, like jellyfin, using mpeg-dash streaming, with solid js front end and when moq (media over quic) gets ready and usable, transition to moq.
- [ ] a Wayland compositor for learning the protocol, using  smithay. or contribute to niri.
- [ ] a columnar database and library, after learning about sstables, red black trees, log structured merge trees, implementing btrees and b+ trees. call it detour. [read this](https://tikv.github.io/deep-dive-tikv/key-value-engine/B-Tree-vs-Log-Structured-Merge-Tree.html)
- [ ] [also](https://johns.codes)
- [ ] a chat application using http3, webtransport for messages, learn about webrtc and VoIP for calls audio and video. then transition to moq if feasible. learn and use Scylla db.
- [ ] understand and implement popular video and audio codecs, and muxer for re encoding and remuxing audio and video. Use as library instead of libffmpeg.
- [ ] learn and implement blurring algorithms.
